// A Fibonacci Heap is a particular implementation of the heap data structure that has a collection of trees that follows either min-heap or max-heap properties

// ->In the Fibonacci heap, there is a pointer that keep tracker of minimum value in the heap.
// ->The smallest value is the root of the tree
// ->All the tree roots in the heap are connected using  a circular doubly linked list

// operations
// 1.Insertion
// 2.Union
// 3.Extracting min
// 4.Decrease Key
// 5.Deletion
